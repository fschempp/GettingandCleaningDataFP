#Data Set Code Book: Wearable Data for Getting and Cleaning data Final Project

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S 
smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
